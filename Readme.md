# Screenshot as a Service

A simple screenshot web service powered by [Express](http://expressjs.com) and [PhantomJS](http://www.phantomjs.org/). Forked from [screenshot-app](http://github.com/visionmedia/screenshot-app).

## Setup

First [install](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation) phantomjs, then clone this repo and install the deps:

```
$ npm install
```

Run the app:

```
$ node app
Express server listening on port 3000
```

## Usage

For a quick test with the command line, type:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:3000/?url=www.google.com > google.png
```

Here is the complete usage documentation, also accessible on `/usage.html`:

```
# Take a screenshot
GET /?url=www.google.com
# Return a 1024x600 PNG screenshot of the www.google.com homepage

# Custom viewport size
GET /?url=www.google.com&width=800&height=600
# Return a 800x600 PNG screenshot of the www.google.com homepage

# Disable JavaScript
GET /?url=www.google.com&javascriptEnabled=false
# Return a screenshot with no JavaScript executed

# Custom User Agent
GET /?url=www.google.com&userAgent=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28iPhone%3B+CPU+iPhone+OS+5_0+like+Mac+OS+X%29+AppleWebKit%2F534.46+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Version%2F5.1+Mobile%2F9A334+Safari%2F7534.48.3
# Return a screenshot using an iPhone browser
# (User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 5_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/534.46 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.1 Mobile/9A334 Safari/7534.48.3)

# Clipping rectangle
GET /?url=www.google.com&clipRect=%7B"top"%3A14%2C"left"%3A3%2C"width"%3A400%2C"height"%3A300%7D
# Return a screenshot clipped at {"top":14,"left":3,"width":400,"height":300}
# When both 'clipRect' and 'clipSelector' are specified, 'clipRect' takes
# precedence.

# Clipping rectangle from selector
GET /?url=www.google.com&clipSelector=#hplogo
# Return a screenshot clipped to the element specified by 'clipSelector'.
# When both 'clipRect' and 'clipSelector' are specified, 'clipRect' takes
# precedence.

# HTTP Authentication
GET /?url=www.mysite.com&userName=johndoe&password=S3cr3t
# Return a screenshot of a website requiring basic http authentication

# Asynchronous call
GET /?url=www.google.com&callback=http://www.myservice.com/screenshot/google
# Return an empty response immediately (HTTP 200 OK),
# then send a POST request to the callback URL when the screenshot is ready
# with the PNG image in the body.

# Screenshot delay
GET /?url=www.google.com&delay=1000
# Return a 1024x600 PNG screenshot of the www.google.com homepage
# 1 second after it's loaded

# Evented screenshot delay
GET /?url=www.modernizr.com&readyExpression=$("html").hasClass("js")
# Return a 1024x600 PNG screenshot of the www.modernizr.com homepage
# when 'html' tag receives class 'js'. The 'readyExpression' gets evaluated
# repeatedly in the page context, the screenshot gets taken once it evaluates
# to true. There is a timeout of 5 seconds after which the screenshot is
# taken regardless.

# Use an HTML form to ask for a screenshot
GET /form.html

# Forwarding cache headers
GET /?url=www.modernizr.com&forwardCacheHeaders=true
# Return a 1024x600 PNG screenshot of the www.modernizr.com homepage
# and set caching-related headers of the screenshot's HTTP response to match
# those of the original page HTTP response. Headers affected are
# 'cache-control', 'expires', 'etag', 'vary' and 'pragma'.
# Cache header forwarding only works when a screenshot is rasterized, not
# when the screenshot is retrieved from the internal file cached (see below).
```

## Internal file cache

Screenshots can be cached, so that frequent requests for the same screenshot
don't slow the service down. When a cached screenshot is served, the
'forwardCacheHeaders' option does not work. File cache is disabled by
default.

## Configuration

Create a `config/development.yaml` or a `config/production.yaml` to override any of the settings found in the `config/default.yaml`:

```yml
rasterizer:
  command: phantomjs   # phantomjs executable
  port: 3001           # internal service port. No need to allow inbound or outbound access to this port
  path: '/tmp/'        # where the screenshot files are stored
  viewport: '1024x600' # browser window size. Height frows according to the content
cache:
  lifetime: 0          # cache time in milliseconds, 0 disables
server:
  port: 3000           # main service port
```

For instance, if you want to setup a proxy for phantomjs, create a `config/development.yaml` as follows:

```yml
rasterizer:
  command: 'phantomjs --proxy=myproxy:1234'
```

## Asynchronous Usage Example

Here is an example application that takes asynchronous screenshots of a list of websites at regular intervals and saves them to disk:

```js
var http = require('http');
var url  = require('url');
var fs   = require('fs');

// create a server to receive callbacks from the screenshot service
// and save the body to a PNG file
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  var name = url.parse(req.url).pathname.slice(1);
  req.on('end', function () {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end();
  });
  req.pipe(fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + '/' + name + '.png'));
}).listen(8124);
console.log("Server running on port 8124");

var sites = {
  'google': 'http://www.google.com',
  'yahoo':  'http://www.yahoo.com'
};
var screenshotServiceUrl = 'http://my.screenshot.app:3000/'; // must be running screenshot-app

// call the screenshot service using the current server as a callback
var poller = function() {
  for (name in sites) {
    var options = url.parse(screenshotServiceUrl + sites[name] + '?callback=http://localhost:8124/' + name);
    http.get(options, function(res) {});
  };
}
setInterval(poller, 60000);
```

Every minute, this script will refresh the two screenshots `google.png` and `yahoo.png`.

## TODO

* Allow to configure phantomjs options through YAML config
* Implement a simple queuing system forcing the use of asynchronous screenshots when the number of browser processes reaches the limit
